## 2. Install mytonctrl

I. Download the installation script. It is better to install the tool under your local user account, not as Root. In our example a local user account is used:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/master/scripts/install.sh
```

II. Run the installation script as administrator:

```sh
sudo bash install.sh -m full
```
